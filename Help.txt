Version 1.0

You need to install JRE (Java Runtime Environment) !

Download it from http://www.filehippo.com/download_jre/ (Windows)

Recommended JRE version : 8.0 build 102

Place your IPK files here then run IPKFeedGenerator.jar

It will create Packages and Packages.gz for you

==================================================

As you know you can run a jar file in any operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS, ...) because it's Java

I did compile it with Java 8u102/NetBeans 8.1 so you need JRE 1.8.x

Enjoy creating IPK feeds
